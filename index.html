    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <h3>
      Bringing a high level of problem-solving and precision to your
      organization.
    </h3>
    <p>
      With over 15 years of work experience in the BPO and the remote staffing
      industry, I have worked extensively with internal teams, customers and
      stakeholders to recognize, strategize, and achieve their business goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armed with a wealth of experience, I am pursuing a more targeted approach
      - by applying my skills and expertise in the tech industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am creating this GitHub page to validate my ability to structure and
      rapidly implement learnings that are essential when starting out a career
      in tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that as a late adopter I am putting myself in a precarious
      position by investing time and energy in a new domain. However, I am
      undeterred - I am confident that the results will speak for itself.
