    <h1>Hi. My name is Antonio.</h1>
    <p>
      I'm 37 years old and I'm an aspiring web developer. You're probably seeing
      this because you are on the same boat. Glad to have you on my page!

    <h2>Not-So-Interesting Stuff About Me</h2>
    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Traditional and Digital Art.</li>
      <li>
        Music. I like songs with creative arrangements. I am pretty
        indiscriminate when it comes to music - I listen to
        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1dfeR4HaWDbWqFHLkxsg1d"
          >Queen</a
        >,
        <a
          href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3utxjLheHaVEd9bPjQRsy8?si=gQZwNE1zQtqK4PSVY_rnDw"
          >Coheed and Cambria</a
        >
        and just recently -
        <a
          href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6mEQK9m2krja6X1cfsAjfl?si=RjEGPdldRWWgqB4WifgBiQ"
          >Ado!</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Online Games - specifically
        <a href="https://www.dota2.com/home">Dota 2</a>! I've been playing this
        game since the Warcraft III mod. I am a proud 2k scrub.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Playing the Guitar. I've been playing guitar on-and-off since my college
        days but have been a bit more serious about it just recently. I make
        sure to at least clock in an hour of practice time every day (I'm at it
        for 8 months and going strong!)
      </li>
      <li>
        Coding. I've always had a love-hate relationship with coding, but it
        always draws me back. I just resumed a week ago after having been away
        for about 2 years. I've always dreamed of creating my own app from
        scratch and that's what keeps me motivated.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Not much to tell, I've lived a pretty mediocre life - always in the middle
      - a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. Don't get me wrong - there are a
      lot of good things by being a generalist (especially in keeping up with
      small talk) - but career-wise, it can be exhausting and unfulfilling.
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p>
      Changing the course of my career (and life) by specializing and starting a
      career in the tech industry.
    </p>

    <h2>Looking For A Coding Buddy</h2>
    <p>
      If you're looking for a coding buddy -
      <a href="mailto:antonio.saqueton@live.com">hit me up</a>! It would be good
      for us if we can keep ourselves challenged and motivated.
